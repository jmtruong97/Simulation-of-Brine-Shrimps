# README - Contents and information file for a
#          Brine Shrimp simulation program that plots the shrimps with their
#          states, sizes, colours and lifecycle. Contains implemented
#          functions to allow user's to input varying parameters through 
#          command line arguments.
#          To run the Brine Shrimp simulation program, input into command line
#          python3 shrimpSimBase.py arg1 arg2 arg3 arg4 arg5 arg6 arg7
#          where it represents XMAX, YMAX, population, age step, time step,
#          death rate and reproduction rate respectfully. Parameters must be 
#          inputed in that exact order. More details on how to use are found
#          in the user guide.
